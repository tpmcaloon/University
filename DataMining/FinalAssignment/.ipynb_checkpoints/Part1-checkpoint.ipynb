    "# Data Mining Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment represents 100% of the Data Mining module’s mark. It is composed of Part 1 which is worth 40 marks, and Part 2 which is worth 60 marks. You can work in a team of 2 students for this assignment. One student per team will be chosen by the team as being the team leader – who will be in charge of coordinating the team’s work, and of submitting the assignment in their account on VLE on behalf of all the team.\n",

    "# PART 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "This task is based on the Sonar real data seen previously in class. Several objects which can be rock or metal cylinders are scanned on different angles and under different conditions, with sonar signals. 60 measurements are recorded per columns for each object (one record per object) and these are the predictors called A1, A2, …, A60. The label associated with each record contains the letter \"R\" if the object is a rock and \"M\" if it is metal cylinder, and this is the outcome variable called Class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two datasets are provided to you: a training dataset in the sonar_train.csv file, and a test dataset in the sonar_test.csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) You are required to write a Python code implementing the simplest Nearest Neighbour algorithm (that is, using just 1 neighbour), with the Minkowski distance, both discussed in lecture of week 1. Your code will read the power q appearing in the Mionkowski distance, and will classify each record from the test dataset based on the training dataset. Remember, to classify a record from the test set you need to find its nearest neighbour in the training set (this is the one which minimizes the distance to the test set record); take the class of the nearest neighbour as the predicted class for the test set record. After classifying all the records in the test set, your code needs to calculate and display the accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 measure with respect to the class \"M\" (which is assumed to be the positive class), of the predictions on the test dataset. Run your code to produce results first for Manhattan distance and then for Euclidian distance, which are particular cases of Minkowski distance (q=1, and q=2, see lecture week 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Run your code for the power q as a positive integer number from 1 to 20 and display the accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 measure on the test set in a chart. Which value of q leads to the best accuracy on the test set?\n",
    "\n",
    "The code, comments, explanations and results will be provided in a Jupyter notebook called Part1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in this task you are not to apply a library for the nearest neighbour algorithm, but you are required to compute the distances, find the nearest neighbour, and so code yourself this simple algorithm."
