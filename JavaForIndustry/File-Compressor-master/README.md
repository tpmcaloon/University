# File-Compressor
This program is neither the fastest nor very efficient memory wise.It is just a simple implementation of Huffman coding in java on Text files(*.txt).

The program uses Canonical Huffman Encoding to generate the compressed output file(Output.txt).
# Tutorial
1.Run the Code(src\FileCompression.java)

2.Select the source file and open it.

3.Select a destination file and save it.Default:Ouput.txt.

4.Click View Codes to view the Huffman Codes(Canonical).Here pseudo EOF is a character added which denotes End of the file.

5.Click Compress to generate the compressed files along with details of compression.
