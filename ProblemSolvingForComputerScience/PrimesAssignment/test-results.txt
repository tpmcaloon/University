Passed test (1 mark): #Task 4:  Does the function return the factors for a semiprime n?
Passed test (1 mark): #Task 4:  Does the function return n it is prime, or false if n is neither a prime nor a semiprime?
Failed test (0 marks): #Task 4:  Does the correctly working function have a better time complexity than n squared? See below for error message 

This semiPrimes function either does not produce the correct output or has two nested loops with O(n) iterations - you could have used a more efficient method using Binary Search: expected false to equal true
